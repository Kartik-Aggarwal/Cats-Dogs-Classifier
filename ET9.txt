Based on the problem statement provided for the "ET9 Tool," which functions similarly to Optical Character Recognition (OCR) in the logistics domain, we can structure a compelling Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA) presentation. Here's how we can outline the content:

---

**Slide 1: Introduction**
- Title: "ET9 Tool: Revolutionizing Bill Processing"
- Introduction to the ET9 Tool and its impact on bill processing efficiency.
- Key Metrics: Daily Hits, Number of Users, Time Saved, and Error Reduction.

---

**Slide 2: Problem Statement**
- Description of the manual bill processing challenges before implementing the ET9 Tool.
  - Manual extraction of information from PDF bills.
  - Time-consuming and error-prone process.
  
---

**Slide 3: Solution Overview**
- Overview of the ET9 Tool:
  - Automated extraction of bill information using OCR technology.
  - Seamless integration into existing workflows.
  
---

**Slide 4: Benefits of ET9 Tool**
- Highlight the advantages of using the ET9 Tool:
  1. **High Usage**: Over 50,000 hits per day.
  2. **User Adoption**: More than 250 billers per day.
  3. **Time Savings**: 19 minutes saved per biller.
  4. **Resource Optimization**: Equivalent to saving 81 hours or 10 FTEs.
  5. **Error Reduction**: Decrease in error rate from 2.19% (January) to 1.47% (March).

  - Reduction in labor costs (FTE savings).
  - Decreased error-related expenses (e.g., rework, customer complaints).
  
---

**Slide 7: Return on Investment (ROI)**
- ROI Calculation:
  - Compare total benefits (cost savings, efficiency gains) to total costs.
  - Illustrate the ROI percentage and payback period.

---

**Slide 8: Future Considerations**
- Future enhancements and scalability of the ET9 Tool:
  - Potential integration with other systems.
  - Continuous improvement to reduce error rates further.

---

**Slide 9: Conclusion**
- Recap of key findings and benefits achieved with the ET9 Tool.
- Summary of the business case for continued investment and expansion.

---

**Slide 10: Q&A**
- Open floor for questions and discussion.

---

**Additional Tips:**
- Use visuals such as graphs, charts, and infographics to illustrate data and trends.
- Keep the presentation concise and focused on key metrics and outcomes.
- Emphasize the tangible business impacts and ROI for stakeholders.
